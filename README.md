JWT Authentication with Node & Express. Demonstrated usage of Authentication tokens and Refresh tokens. Two different servers are used. One one them specifically handles the logging in, logging out, and re-generation of Auth tokens once they have expired using the concept of a 'refresh' token. This also means that we can scale the authentication server separately from our main API server.

Based on an example given by Web Dev Simplified.
